This is a copy of most of the source code behind http://theindependent.ca/

The current purpose of this repo is to allow people who will be helping with the developlment of theindependent.ca get familiar with the code base.

Three important pieces are missing to successfully run this project locally:
(1) wp-config.php
(2) A mock database
(3) Instructions on how to run this project locally

These will be added shortly. Eventually, the local environment will be run from docker.

In the future, we will not include plug-ins in the repo.
